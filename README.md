# Abstract
The purpose of this master’s thesis is to reveal if the Speculum Scribe used both Saint Petersburg, BAN, O 256 and Brussels, KBR, 2979 as an exemplar when he constructed Vienna, ÖNB, SN 12.857. These three manuscripts all contain the complete Middle Dutch translation of the four gospels. In previous research, Kwakkel (2002) manually compared specific lines from the three manuscripts (pp. 48-51), while Vandyck, Haverals, and Kestemont (2024) computationally analysed mean abbreviations densities and plotted bag-of-words models for their corpus, which included these three codices. The current research will perform an in-depth analysis based on concepts from the field of scribal profiling in order to develop a more detailed understanding of the relationship between these manuscripts. The corpus consists of automatic transcriptions created by HTR-models; the model used for the Saint Petersburg manuscript was trained specifically for this research. Distinctive linguistic traits of the manuscripts will be uncovered and the orthograpic variation between the Viennese manuscript and its potential exemplars will be diachronically analysed. These computational methods revealed that the Speculum Scribe likely used the Saint Petersburg and Brussels manuscripts as exemplars, although this can only be said with confidence for certain segments of the texts, specifally the gospel of Matthew and Mark for the Viennese manuscripts, but only the gospel of Mark for the Brussels manuscript. Additionally, a number of specific linguistic traits of the Speculum Scribe could be identified.
